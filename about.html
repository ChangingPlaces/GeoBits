          <h1>ABOUT</h1>
          <h3>What is this site? What is GeoBits></h3>
          <p>My name is Nina Lutz and I'm a sophomore at MIT studying Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Design.
          I am an undergraduate researcher, or UROP at the MIT Media Lab Changing Places Group, where I work with Ira Winder on solving spatial problems via intervention systems.</p>
          <p>People around MIT know the CityScope project for being that cool intervention tool with Legos. Which is fair, because we use Legos as an actual unit in our Tangible User Interfaces or TUIs.
            We use Legos because they invite people to play with and interact with our platforms to make interventions. Also, Legos are a convenient and standardized grid system. Each Lego is made up of a ratio of studs and together on our table they make up a grid of Lego squares and the studs within these squares.</p>
            <p>In the data and computer science world, this process is called rasterization, which is breaking up big systems of stuff (usually images) and turning it into a grid of discrete objects.<p>
          <p>This is how most of the data at CityScope, and other spatial programs, is processed. But its usually a lot of math and doesn't tend to be seen as its own system, so there is room to add some elegance, as well as some genericness, by using global databases instead of just individual files.</p>
          <p>I've spent the last few months paying a lot of attention to processing and rendering this data and realized just how dense and powerful geospatial data can be for visualizing complex systems and making some really powerful math models.</p>
          <p>That's where GeoBits comes in, the main goals being...</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p> 1. Rendering beautiful, interactive geospatial data at a global to pedestrian scale.</p>
          <p>    2. Layering different forms of information and metadata associated with this geospatial data.</p>
          <p>    3. Transforming this data into a variety of coordinate systems for modeling purposes. </p>
          <p>    4. Allowing users to define sandboxes to layer different intervention models on.</p>
          <p>    5. Documenting all this in an approachable way for programmers and non programmers to understand my development process and geospatial data.</p>
          <p>    6. Making an awesome tangible user interface (TUI) and tangible information matrix (TIM) that is at the MIT Media Lab (if you ever want to see it). <p>
          </blockquote>
            </p>
        <p> I'm excited for this project, and this site serves as a live updated, documentation of my development process.</p>
